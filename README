About
-----
https://github.com/anowacki/elasticity.git

This repo contains command-line programs which are useful for dealing with sets
of elastic constants.


Installation
------------
A Fortran compiler is required.  The code relies heavily on my Fortran utility
modules, which you can get from

	https://github.com/anowacki/seismo-fortran.git

I recommend you first check out this repo (by default, to a directory called
~/Applications/modules), then build the libraries it contains.  Follow the
instructions contained therein.

When you are ready, set the path to the modules discuessed above in the
Makefile, as well as the name of your Fortran compiler and the path to a
directory where you'd like to install the programs.  Type `make' in the root
directory to compile and install the progams.

Plotting scripts rely on the Generic Mapping Tools (available at
http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu), and specifically version 4.


Using the programs
------------------
At the moment, most of the programs are poorly documented.  Look at the source
or run the program with no arguments (or with -h) to see how to run them.

See the file PROGRAMS for a listing of what each installed program does.
